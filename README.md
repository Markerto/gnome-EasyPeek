# gnome-EasyPeek
A lightweight GNOME extension that lets you minimize every open app by clicking anywhere on the desktop.

Tested on GNOME 48. Should work on 45, 46, 47, 48. Works fine with other similar extensions like Show Desktop Button.
Currently doesn't work with extensions like Desktop Icons.
