# gnome-EasyPeek
A lightweight GNOME extension that shows you your desktop by clicking anywhere on the desktop. Clicking on the desktop minimizes every app.

Tested on GNOME 48. Should work on 45, 46, 47, 48. Works fine with other similar extensions like Show Desktop Button.
Currently doesn't work with the Desktop Icons extension.
